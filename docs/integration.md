# Integration

Kelos integrates with external systems in two ways:

1. **TaskSpawner** — Kelos natively watches external sources and automatically creates Tasks. No glue code needed.
2. **Direct Task creation** — Create Task resources from your own workflows (GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines, scripts, etc.) for full control over when and how agents run.

## TaskSpawner: Native Integration

TaskSpawner watches external sources and creates Tasks automatically for each discovered work item:

```
External Source → TaskSpawner (polls/watches) → Task → Agent runs in Pod
```

One TaskSpawner handles the full lifecycle — discovery, filtering, Task creation, concurrency control, and optional status reporting back to the source.

### GitHub Issues

React to issues in a GitHub repository. The spawner polls the GitHub API and creates a Task for each issue matching your filters.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: fix-bugs
spec:
  when:
    githubIssues:
      labels: [bug]
      excludeLabels: [needs-triage]
      state: open
      pollInterval: 5m
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      Fix the following GitHub issue and open a PR with the fix.

      Issue #{{.Number}}: {{.Title}}

      {{.Body}}
    branch: "fix-{{.Number}}"
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600
  maxConcurrency: 3
```

**Filtering options:** `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `assignee`, `author`, `types` (issues, pulls, or both).

**Comment-based control:** Use `commentPolicy` to let users trigger or exclude agents via issue comments. Combine with authorization rules (`allowedUsers`, `allowedTeams`, or `minimumPermission`) to control who can invoke agents:

```yaml
commentPolicy:
  triggerComment: "/kelos run"
  excludeComments: ["/kelos stop"]
  minimumPermission: write   # only repo collaborators can trigger
```

**Status reporting:** Set `reporting.comments: {}` to post status updates (started, succeeded, failed) back to the issue. The default `PerTask` mode creates one comment for each Task. Set `reporting.comments.mode: Sticky` to maintain one comment per TaskSpawner and issue across Tasks.

### GitHub Pull Requests

React to pull requests — review code, respond to feedback, or enforce standards.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: pr-reviewer
spec:
  when:
    githubPullRequests:
      labels: [needs-review]
      state: open
      reviewState: any
      pollInterval: 5m
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      Review pull request #{{.Number}}: {{.Title}}

      {{.Body}}

      Branch: {{.Branch}}
      Review state: {{.ReviewState}}

      {{.ReviewComments}}
    branch: "{{.Branch}}"
  maxConcurrency: 2
```

**PR-specific variables:** `{{.Branch}}` (head branch), `{{.ReviewState}}` (`approved`, `changes_requested`), `{{.ReviewComments}}` (inline review comments).

**Additional filters:** `reviewState`, `author`, `draft`.

**Status reporting:** Two independent options:

- `reporting.comments` posts status comments (started, succeeded, failed) on the PR. `mode: PerTask` is the default and creates one comment for each Task. `mode: Sticky` maintains one comment per TaskSpawner and PR across Tasks.
- `reporting.checks.name` creates a GitHub Check Run for each PR task, so the run can be required by branch protection rules or referenced from a merge queue. The Check Run starts as `in_progress` when the task begins and is updated to `success` or `failure` on completion. The name defaults to `"Kelos: <taskspawner-name>"` and appears in branch protection rule configuration and the PR Checks tab; the token referenced by the workspace must have `checks:write` permission.

```yaml
spec:
  when:
    githubPullRequests:
      labels: [needs-review]
      reporting:
        comments:
          mode: Sticky           # one status comment across Tasks
        checks:
          name: kelos/pr-review  # required-status-check name (optional override)
```

To require the Check Run before merge, open the GitHub repository's **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rule** for the target branch, enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**, and add the same name (`kelos/pr-review` or the default `Kelos: <taskspawner-name>`) to the required checks list. Renaming the TaskSpawner changes the default name, so pin the name with `reporting.checks.name` if you reference it from branch protection or merge queue config.

> **Note:** `reporting.checks` is supported for `githubPullRequests` and for `githubWebhook` sources that include a pull-request event type or have at least one `issue_comment` filter with all such filters set to `commentOn: PullRequest`. It is rejected at admission for `githubIssues` sources.

### GitHub Webhooks

React to GitHub webhook events in real time — issues, pull requests, pushes, reviews, and more. Unlike the polling-based GitHub Issues and Pull Requests sources, webhooks provide instant response to repository events.

#### Supported GitHub Event Types

| Event Type | Description | Available Filter Fields | Template Variables |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issues` | Issue opened, edited, labeled, closed, etc. | `action`, `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `bodyPattern`, `excludeBodyPatterns` | `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Number}}`, `{{.Body}}`, `{{.URL}}` |
| `pull_request` | PR opened, closed, synchronize, labeled, etc. | `action`, `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `branch`, `draft`, `bodyPattern`, `excludeBodyPatterns`, `filePatterns` | `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Number}}`, `{{.Body}}`, `{{.URL}}`, `{{.Branch}}` |
| `pull_request_review` | Review submitted, edited, dismissed | `action`, `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `draft`, `bodyPattern`, `excludeBodyPatterns` | `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Number}}`, `{{.Body}}`, `{{.URL}}`, `{{.Branch}}`, `{{.CommentBody}}`, `{{.CommentURL}}` |
| `pull_request_review_comment` | Review comment created, edited, deleted | `action`, `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `draft`, `bodyPattern`, `excludeBodyPatterns` | `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Number}}`, `{{.Body}}`, `{{.URL}}`, `{{.Branch}}`, `{{.CommentBody}}`, `{{.CommentURL}}` |
| `pull_request_target` | Like `pull_request` but runs in context of the base branch | Same as `pull_request` | Same as `pull_request` |
| `issue_comment` | Comment on an issue or PR | `action`, `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `bodyPattern`, `excludeBodyPatterns`, `commentOn` | `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Number}}`, `{{.Body}}`, `{{.URL}}`, `{{.CommentBody}}`, `{{.CommentURL}}`, `{{.Branch}}` (PR comments only) |
| `push` | Push to a branch | `branch`, `filePatterns` | `{{.ID}}` (head commit SHA), `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Ref}}`, `{{.Branch}}` |
| `create` | Branch or tag created | `branch` (ref_type=branch), `tag` (ref_type=tag) | `{{.ID}}` (ref name), `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Ref}}`, `{{.RefType}}`, `{{.Branch}}` or `{{.Tag}}` |
| `release` | Release published, created, edited, etc. | `action`, `tag` | `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Body}}`, `{{.URL}}`, `{{.Tag}}` |

All event types support the `author` and `excludeAuthors` filter fields, and expose `{{.Event}}`, `{{.Action}}`, `{{.Sender}}`, `{{.Repository}}`, `{{.RepositoryOwner}}`, `{{.RepositoryName}}`, and `{{.Payload}}` template variables.

`author` and `excludeAuthors` match the **event sender** — the account that produced the delivery. They do not match the pull request author, so a human acting on a bot-authored PR (taking it out of draft, reopening it, commenting) produces an event that `excludeAuthors` admits. To match the pull request author instead, use the `pullRequestAuthor` criterion. It is available on pull-request-bearing events, including `pull_request`, `pull_request_target`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `pull_request_review_thread`, and `issue_comment` on a pull request; an event carrying no pull request author never matches it. Matching is exact and case-sensitive. To exclude rather than accept, put the criterion in `excludeFilters`: entries there reject an event when any of them matches, are evaluated outside the accepting `filters` list, and may omit `event` to apply across every subscribed event type. Note that on the polling sources `githubIssues` and `githubPullRequests`, the identically named `excludeAuthors` field matches the issue or PR author rather than a sender.

Events not in this list can still be specified in `events` — they will be parsed with best-effort field extraction from the raw JSON payload: the sender, the action, and the pull request author when the payload carries a top-level `pull_request` object. That last one is what makes `pullRequestAuthor` work for `pull_request_target` and `pull_request_review_thread`. The criteria that read structured issue, pull request, or check-run fields — `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `draft`, `commentOn`, `bodyPattern`, `excludeBodyPatterns`, `conclusion`, `checkName` — do not apply to these events.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: webhook-responder
spec:
  when:
    githubWebhook:
      events:
        - "issues"
        - "pull_request"
        - "issue_comment"
      excludeAuthors:
        - "dependabot[bot]"
      # Ignore events on pull requests this bot opened, whoever sent them.
      # Applies across every subscribed event because it omits `event`.
      excludeFilters:
        - pullRequestAuthor: "dependabot[bot]"
      filters:
        - event: "issues"
          action: "opened"
          labels: ["bug"]
        - event: "issue_comment"
          action: "created"
          bodyPattern: "/kelos"
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      A {{.Event}} event ({{.Action}}) was triggered by @{{.Sender}}.

      {{with index . "Title"}}Title: {{.}}{{end}}
      {{with index . "URL"}}URL: {{.}}{{end}}

      Please investigate and take appropriate action.
    branch: "webhook-{{.Event}}-{{.ID}}"
  maxConcurrency: 3
```

**Setup:** Configure your GitHub repository to send webhooks to your Kelos instance and create a secret with the webhook signing secret. See [example 10](../examples/10-taskspawner-github-webhook/) for full setup instructions.

**Filtering options:** `events` (required), `repository`, `excludeAuthors`, `excludeFilters`, and per-filter fields: `action`, `labels`, `excludeLabels`, `state`, `branch`, `draft`, `author`, `pullRequestAuthor`, `bodyPattern`, `excludeBodyPatterns`, `commentOn` (scopes `issue_comment` events to `"Issue"` or `"PullRequest"`). The legacy `bodyContains` substring filter is **deprecated** — use `bodyPattern` (Go re2 regular expression) instead.

**Status reporting:** Like `githubPullRequests`, the webhook source supports `reporting.comments` (status comments back to the originating issue or PR) and `reporting.checks.name` (GitHub Check Runs for branch protection). Comment mode defaults to `PerTask`; `Sticky` maintains one comment per TaskSpawner and originating issue or PR across Tasks. Check Runs require `events` to include at least one pull-request event type (`pull_request`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, or `pull_request_target`), or to include `issue_comment` with at least one matching filter and every `issue_comment` filter set to `commentOn: PullRequest`. Other configurations are rejected at admission. An `issue_comment` Check Run is associated with the pull request's current head SHA, which Kelos fetches from GitHub before creating the Task.

**Webhook-specific variables:** `{{.Event}}`, `{{.Action}}`, `{{.Sender}}`, `{{.Ref}}`, `{{.Repository}}`, `{{.Payload}}` (full payload access).

### Jira

React to Jira issues. The spawner polls the Jira API (Cloud or Data Center/Server) using JQL.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: jira-worker
spec:
  when:
    jira:
      baseUrl: https://your-org.atlassian.net
      project: ENG
      jql: "status = Open AND priority in (High, Highest)"
      secretRef:
        name: jira-credentials
      pollInterval: 10m
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      Fix the following Jira issue:

      {{.Title}}

      {{.Body}}
    branch: "jira-{{.ID}}"
  maxConcurrency: 2
```

The Jira secret requires a `JIRA_TOKEN` key. For Jira Cloud, also include `JIRA_USER` (your email):

```bash
# Jira Cloud
kubectl create secret generic jira-credentials \
  --from-literal=JIRA_USER=you@example.com \
  --from-literal=JIRA_TOKEN=<your-api-token>

# Jira Data Center / Server (Bearer token)
kubectl create secret generic jira-credentials \
  --from-literal=JIRA_TOKEN=<your-pat>
```

### Vikunja

React to tasks in a [Vikunja](https://vikunja.io) project. The spawner polls the Vikunja API.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: vikunja-worker
spec:
  when:
    vikunja:
      baseUrl: https://vikunja.example.com
      projectId: 49
      filter: "done = false && labels in 5"
      secretRef:
        name: vikunja-credentials
      pollInterval: 10m
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      Fix the following Vikunja task:

      {{.Title}}

      {{.Body}}
    branch: "vikunja-{{.ID}}"
  maxConcurrency: 2
```

`filter` is scoped to the project — do not include a `project = ...` clause. When
omitted, only open tasks are discovered (`"done = false"`); when set, it is used
as-is instead of that default.

The Vikunja secret requires a `VIKUNJA_TOKEN` key (a Vikunja API token, sent as a Bearer token):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic vikunja-credentials \
  --from-literal=VIKUNJA_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
```

`vikunja` is a `v1alpha2`-only source: a client that reads and writes the
TaskSpawner through `v1alpha1` does not see this field, though the source
survives a round-trip through that older API version via an internal
annotation.

### Linear Webhooks

React to Linear webhook events in real time — issues, comments, and more. The webhook server receives events from Linear and creates Tasks for matching items.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: linear-responder
spec:
  when:
    linearWebhook:
      types:
        - "Issue"
      filters:
        - action: "create"
          states:
            - "Todo"
            - "In Progress"
          labels:
            - "agent-task"
          excludeLabels:
            - "no-automation"
        - action: "update"
          states:
            - "Todo"
            - "In Progress"
          labels:
            - "agent-task"
          excludeLabels:
            - "no-automation"
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      Linear {{.Type}} {{.Action}}: {{.Title}}

      Linear Issue ID: {{.ID}}
      State: {{.State}}
      Labels: {{.Labels}}

      Please analyze this Linear issue and take appropriate action.
    branch: "linear-task-{{.ID}}"
  maxConcurrency: 3
```

**Setup:** Configure the `kelos-webhook-server` for Linear in your Helm values and create a webhook secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic linear-webhook-secret \
  --from-literal=WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-linear-webhook-secret
```

Then configure a webhook in Linear (Settings → API → Webhooks) pointing to `https://your-webhook-domain/webhook/linear` with the same secret. See [example 11](../examples/11-taskspawner-linear-webhook/) for full setup instructions including optional Linear API key configuration for Comment label enrichment.

**Filtering options:** `types` (required — e.g., `"Issue"`, `"Comment"`), and per-filter fields: `action` (`create`, `update`, `remove`), `states`, `labels`, `excludeLabels`.

**Linear-specific variables:** `{{.Type}}` (resource type), `{{.State}}` (workflow state), `{{.Action}}` (webhook action), `{{.IssueID}}` (parent issue ID for Comment events), `{{.Labels}}`, `{{.Payload}}` (full payload access).

### Generic Webhooks

React to arbitrary HTTP POST events from any system that can deliver a JSON payload — Sentry, Notion, Slack, Drata, PagerDuty, internal services, or anything else. Unlike the GitHub and Linear webhook sources, the generic webhook source has no built-in knowledge of any particular schema; you describe how to extract fields and what to filter on using JSONPath expressions.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: sentry-error-responder
spec:
  when:
    webhook:
      source: sentry            # URL: /webhook/sentry
      fieldMapping:
        id: "$.data.event.event_id"   # required — used for deduplication and task naming
        title: "$.data.event.title"
        url: "$.data.url"
        level: "$.data.event.level"
      filters:
        - field: "$.data.event.level"
          value: "error"
        - field: "$.data.event.platform"
          pattern: "^(python|go|node)"
      excludeFilters:                   # any match skips the delivery
        - field: "$.data.event.environment"
          value: "staging"
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      A new Sentry error was reported.

      Title: {{.Title}}
      Level: {{.level}}
      URL:   {{.URL}}

      Investigate the stack trace in the payload and open a PR with a fix.
    branch: "sentry-{{.ID}}"
  maxConcurrency: 3
```

**Setup:** Enable the `generic` source on `kelos-webhook-server` in your Helm values:

```yaml
# Helm values
webhookServer:
  sources:
    generic:
      enabled: true
```

The webhook URL is `https://your-webhook-domain/webhook/<source>` (e.g., `/webhook/sentry`).

> [!WARNING]
> **The generic webhook endpoint is currently unauthenticated.** The handler does not validate request signatures, so any client that can reach `/webhook/<source>` and matches a registered TaskSpawner can trigger Task creation. Until per-source HMAC validation is implemented (tracked in [#1040](https://github.com/kelos-dev/kelos/issues/1040)), restrict access at the network layer:
>
> - Use a `NetworkPolicy` to limit ingress to known sender CIDRs.
> - Front the endpoint with an Ingress / Gateway that enforces IP allowlisting or mTLS.
> - Avoid exposing the webhook Service as `LoadBalancer` on a public network unless ingress is otherwise restricted.
>
> The `webhookServer.sources.generic.secretName` Helm value is reserved for future HMAC validation; it currently mounts env vars that no code reads.

**Configuration:**

- **`source`** *(required)* — short identifier (lowercase alphanumeric with optional hyphens) that determines the URL path (`/webhook/<source>`).
- **`fieldMapping`** *(required)* — map of template variable name → JSONPath expression evaluated against the request body. Each key becomes `{{.Key}}` in `promptTemplate` and `branch`. Lowercase keys `id`, `title`, `body`, and `url` are also exposed under their canonical uppercase aliases (`{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Body}}`, `{{.URL}}`) for compatibility with templates written for the GitHub or Linear sources. The **`id` key is required** — it is used for delivery deduplication and Task naming. Missing fields produce empty strings (no error); only malformed JSONPath expressions fail.
- **`filters[]`** *(optional)* — list of conditions that must ALL match for a delivery to trigger a Task (AND semantics across filters). Each filter has a `field` (JSONPath) and exactly one of:
  - `value` — exact string match against the extracted value
  - `pattern` — Go [regexp](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax) match against the extracted value
  
  When `filters` is empty, every delivery triggers a Task. A filter whose `field` is missing in the payload fails (the delivery is skipped).
- **`excludeFilters[]`** *(optional)* — list of conditions that reject a delivery when ANY of them matches (OR semantics across exclude filters). Entries have the same shape as `filters` — a `field` (JSONPath) and exactly one of `value` or `pattern`. They are evaluated after `filters`, so a delivery triggers a Task only when it matches every entry in `filters` and no entry in `excludeFilters`. An exclude filter whose `field` is missing in the payload does not match, so it never excludes the delivery.

A malformed JSONPath expression in either list is a configuration error: the spawner is skipped for that delivery and the error is logged.

**Generic-webhook variables:** `{{.Kind}}` is always `"GenericWebhook"`, `{{.Payload}}` is the full parsed JSON body (use it for advanced templating like `{{.Payload.data.event.platform}}`), and every key from `fieldMapping` becomes a top-level variable. Standard fields `{{.ID}}`, `{{.Title}}`, `{{.Body}}`, and `{{.URL}}` always exist (empty if not mapped).

See [example 13](../examples/13-taskspawner-generic-webhook/) for a full setup walkthrough.

### Cron

Run agents on a schedule — dependency updates, code health checks, or periodic maintenance.

```yaml
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: TaskSpawner
metadata:
  name: weekly-deps
spec:
  when:
    cron:
      schedule: "0 9 * * 1"  # Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
  taskTemplate:
    type: claude-code
    workspaceRef:
      name: my-workspace
    credentials:
      type: oauth
      secretRef:
        name: claude-oauth-token
    promptTemplate: |
      Check for outdated dependencies and open a PR to update them.
      Triggered at: {{.Time}}
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600
```

### Template Variables

All `promptTemplate` and `branch` fields support Go `text/template` syntax. Available variables depend on the source:

## Direct Task Creation: Workflow Integration

For workflows that TaskSpawner doesn't cover natively, create Task resources directly. Any system that can run `kubectl apply` or call the Kubernetes API can trigger agent runs.

This approach gives you full control over when Tasks are created and lets you integrate kelos into existing CI/CD pipelines, custom automation, or one-off scripts.

### GitHub Actions

Trigger an agent run from a GitHub Actions workflow. This is useful for tasks that should run in response to CI events (push, release, workflow_dispatch) rather than issue or PR activity.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/kelos-task.yaml
name: Run Kelos Task
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      prompt:
        description: "Task prompt"
        required: true

jobs:
  run-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Configure kubeconfig
        run: |
          # Configure access to your Kubernetes cluster
          # (e.g., via cloud provider CLI, kubeconfig secret, etc.)

      - name: Create Task
        run: |
          cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
          apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
          kind: Task
          metadata:
            name: gha-task-${{ github.run_id }}
          spec:
            type: claude-code
            prompt: "${{ github.event.inputs.prompt }}"
            credentials:
              type: oauth
              secretRef:
                name: claude-oauth-token
            workspaceRef:
              name: my-workspace
            ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600
          EOF

      - name: Wait for Task completion
        run: |
          kubectl wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Succeeded \
            task/gha-task-${{ github.run_id }} --timeout=30m
```

You can also use this pattern to create Tasks on push events, after releases, or as part of a larger CI/CD pipeline.

### Shell Scripts and Automation

Use the `kelos` CLI or `kubectl` from any script:

```bash
# Using the kelos CLI
kelos run \
  -p "Investigate the flaky test in ci_test.go and fix it" \
  --workspace my-workspace \
  --branch fix-flaky-test \
  --timeout 30m \
  -w

# Using kubectl
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: fix-flaky-test
spec:
  type: claude-code
  prompt: "Investigate the flaky test in ci_test.go and fix it"
  credentials:
    type: api-key
    secretRef:
      name: anthropic-api-key
  workspaceRef:
    name: my-workspace
  branch: fix-flaky-test
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600
  podOverrides:
    activeDeadlineSeconds: 1800
EOF
```

### Kubernetes API (Programmatic)

Any Kubernetes client library can create Tasks. Example with Python:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

config.load_kube_config()
api = client.CustomObjectsApi()

task = {
    "apiVersion": "kelos.dev/v1alpha2",
    "kind": "Task",
    "metadata": {"name": "programmatic-task"},
    "spec": {
        "type": "claude-code",
        "prompt": "Add input validation to the /api/users endpoint",
        "credentials": {
            "type": "api-key",
            "secretRef": {"name": "anthropic-api-key"},
        },
        "workspaceRef": {"name": "my-workspace"},
        "branch": "add-validation",
    },
}

api.create_namespaced_custom_object(
    group="kelos.dev",
    version="v1alpha2",
    namespace="default",
    plural="tasks",
    body=task,
)
```

### Reading Task Results

After a Task completes, its status contains structured outputs:

```bash
# Check task status
kubectl get task fix-flaky-test -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'

# Get the PR URL
kubectl get task fix-flaky-test -o jsonpath='{.status.results.pr}'

# Get all results
kubectl get task fix-flaky-test -o jsonpath='{.status.results}'
```

Available result keys: `branch`, `commit`, `base-branch`, `pr`, `cost-usd`, `input-tokens`, `output-tokens`.

This makes it straightforward to chain a kelos Task into a larger pipeline — create the Task, wait for completion, then read the results and act on them.

## Choosing an Approach

| | TaskSpawner | Direct Task |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Continuous, event-driven workflows | One-off runs, CI/CD integration, custom triggers |
| **Setup** | Declare once, runs continuously | Create Task per invocation |
| **Concurrency control** | Built-in (`maxConcurrency`, `maxTotalTasks`) | You manage it |
| **Source filtering** | Labels, state, comments, assignees, review state | Your workflow logic decides when to create Tasks |
| **Status reporting** | Can post back to GitHub issues | You read `status.results` and act on them |
| **Examples** | Watch all `bug` issues, respond to PR reviews | Run agent after deploy, trigger from Slack bot |

Both approaches use the same Task resource under the hood — TaskSpawner is an automation layer that creates Tasks for you. Everything a TaskSpawner-created Task can do, a directly created Task can do too.
